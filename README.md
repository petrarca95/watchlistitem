# Watchlist application static pages

This project contains static HTML pages to be used as the starting point for the Watchlist application that will be developed during the [Create web applications efficiently with the SpringBoot MVC](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5684146) course. 

Through out the course we will add these files one by one and will make them dynamic by adding Thymeleaf's elements to them. This is to avoid getting distracted by HTML and CSS details and staying focused on the main purpose of the course which is back-end Java development and Spring concepts.
